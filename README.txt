"test" is the folder you should be using to test, as it contains relevant files and filenames. only open "oldtest" if the "test" folder's unit tests don't work. "oldtest" consists of more or less the same+original files, but also original filenames as well (which may not seem fitting, but the files SHOULD BE fully functional). there is also another README that contains setup instructions for the tests (in both folders). in "test", the unit test is called "test.cpp". in "oldtest", this is instead called "brandon.cpp" - named after the student who created it.
